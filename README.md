# frameLoader
**frameLoader** is a jQuery UI based widget that automatically resizes iFrames based on the iFrame content. **frameLoader** is built on top of [windowMessenger](https://github.com/dbudde/windowMessenger), which handles the communication between the parent window and the iFrame. Both widgets are jQuery and jQuery UI dependent.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/dbudde/frameLoader/wiki) for more information and code examples.
